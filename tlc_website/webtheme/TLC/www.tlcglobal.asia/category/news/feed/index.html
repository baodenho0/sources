<p>The coronavirus pandemic is causing economic disruptions globally and fluctuations on global financial markets. While dark clouds are obscuring views in this event, we are preparing to act when the sky is clearer.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is already causing great economic harm globally, which will have implications for developing economies. According to John Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organisation and additional sources, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in 197,000 cases worldwide, with at least 7,900 deaths, as of 18<sup>th</sup> March 2020.</p>
<p>World Bank Group vice president of equitable growth, finance and institutions Ceyla Pazarbasioglu stated that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has already exacted a high cost in human life and has been recognised as a global health emergency. As the virus spreads around the globe, the question now is whether lives can be protected and economic harm can be contained.</p>
<p>No one can reliably predict the full economic impact of the outbreak. Too much depends on what is unknowable — how long the outbreak lasts, how many countries it afflicts, and the extent to which a coordinated, concerted, fast-track policy response is mobilised and sustained. But what is known is that the outbreak arrived at a weak point for the world economy, when global growth was beginning to pick up from its lowest rate since the 2009 financial crisis.</p>
<p>That has troubling implications for developing economies: Tighter credit conditions, weaker growth, and the diversion of government resources to fight the outbreak would reduce funds available for key development priorities. An economic slump would also set back the fight against extreme poverty. It is imperative, therefore, that policymakers everywhere recognise how economic harm can be transmitted from one country to another — and to act quickly to prevent its spread.</p>
<p>That transmission is likely to occur through several channels. The first is trade: global value chains, which account for nearly half of global trade, are being disrupted by factory shutdowns and delayed resumption of operations. The second is foreign financial flows, which could be shifted away from coronavirus-affected countries. The third is domestic capital — human as well as financial — which is becoming underutilised as factories are idled and people stay at home. The fourth is transport and tourism, a major revenue stream for many developing countries that is shrinking with declining demand and expanding travel restrictions. Finally, sharp drops in commodity prices will harm developing countries that rely on them for much-needed revenue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6786" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Picture2.png" alt="" width="498" height="463" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Picture2.png 498w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Picture2-300x279.png 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Picture2-24x22.png 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Picture2-36x33.png 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Picture2-48x45.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /></p>
<p>The outbreak of a virus causes fluctuations on global financial markets. According to Bank of International Settlements senior economist for monetary and economic department for financial markets Fernando Avalos, and monetary and economic department advisor Egon Zakrajsek, when making a comparison between Covid-19 and the early 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), fluctuations in the global risk factor may be driven by investors’ concerns about the global economic fallout of a virus outbreak.</p>
<p>Given that the current chaotic trend, the US dollar is becoming a safe haven currency at this moment. As the world’s financial markets are collapsing, with stock markets and commodities being affected, this development is making our Expert Advisory risk management extremely difficult to manage. Given that the forex market has faced challenges, TLC has been taking extra precautions to prevent sudden huge slippage spread spikes that can defeat all kinds of trades. As our trading strategy has created a good run, we are upgrading our Expert Advisory and trading system by adding in new conditions and new indicators. Given the change in the economic situation, time is needed to create a new Expert Advisory system to suit the market. With five years of achieving good results for our investors, rest assured that TLC will continue to track market developments in global financial markets to ensure we can achieve good financial returns on our clients’ investments. We are committed to creating opportunities for you to obtain great profits. Let’s embrace the opportunities ahead of us, now is the best time to invest for a brighter future! Prepare for better times, by letting us, TLC, to become your partner that can guide your financial decisions in years to come</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TLC is the exclusive sponsor for a business sharing event jointly organised by HSBC and </em><em>Evermind Marketing and Production Limited</em></p>
<p>The sponsorship is one of TLC&#8217;s many initiatives to drive businesses forward and develop innovative business models. Since its inception, the company is committed to seeking new ways to expand the market, while actively integrating advanced technologies with the aim to develop more beneficial solutions. This not only bolsters the growth of the market as a whole, but also helps TLC in establishing its brand image, increase brand awareness and build prestige, benefiting the company&#8217;s development in the long run.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6716" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-471x1024.png" alt="" width="471" height="1024" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-471x1024.png 471w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-138x300.png 138w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-11x24.png 11w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-17x36.png 17w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-22x48.png 22w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png 493w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The event is one of TLC’s initiatives to create an environment where businesses thrive so everyone can get their share of the cake</em></p>
<p>TLC lent the event its full support with the intention of aiding business peers with the challenges discussed at the forum – how to perfectly combine business breakthroughs and adapt to market trends.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs must understand from the get-go that corporate culture is the key that can easily result in the rise and fall of a company. For a business to go further and build public confidence, the company’s behaviour must be consistent with its corporate values and philosophy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6717" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-1.png" alt="" width="865" height="577" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-1.png 865w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-1-768x512.png 768w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-1-24x16.png 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-1-36x24.png 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-1-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Industry veterans share business insight with participants</em></p>
<p>TLC believes that integrity builds credibility and expertise creates long-term stability. Therefore, the company always seeks to uphold sincerity and honesty in its dealings with stakeholders. Equipped with expertise in technology and forex, TLC will continue to develop innovative solutions and stay ahead of market trends, while creating mutual benefits for the company and its investors.</p>
<p>In the time to come, TLC will work toward becoming one of only a handful of companies in the forex industry that constantly innovate, making technology an essential part of financial management and bringing more benefits to the public.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Traders Fair Singapore opens on 26<sup>th</sup> October at Marina Bay Sands Expo &amp; Convention Centre</em></p>
<p>On 26<sup>th</sup> October 2019, TLC exhibited at Traders Fair Singapore held at Marina Bay Sands Expo &amp; Convention Centre. The world-class financial event was organised by FINEXPO, the world&#8217;s largest financial trade fair organiser.</p>
<p>The expo tours through many countries every year. It has already checked in at Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Philippines and South Korea this year and set to wrap up its 2019 tour in Vietnam and South Africa. As expected, the exhibition attracted top financial service providers and organisations from all over the world. International investors were also eager to explore the latest investment opportunities available at the fair.</p>
<p>Singapore is the 4th largest financial centre in the world following Hong Kong, which is behind New York and London. Joining an event in a region with such strong economic development is part of TLC’s strategic deployment in its advancement into the international market, to increase corporate exposure and raise brand awareness among industry peers and investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6701" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.png" alt="" width="940" height="529" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.png 940w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-24x14.png 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-36x20.png 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Singapore’s economic development is strong and robust, making it the 4<sup>th</sup> largest financial centre in the world</em></p>
<p>Response from expo-goers was overwhelming, making TLC one of the most popular booths at the fair. The crowd was eager to learn about TLC&#8217;s sustainable investment mechanism fortified with highly secure fund protection feature. The onslaught of visitors was greeted by professional TLC staff, who provided detailed explanations while exploring the possibilities of innovative forex trading with investors. In addition, TLC&#8217;s overseas investors came from far and wide to lend their support at the event.</p>

<p>Guests hail from various international financial sectors that include banking, fund, trust, currency brokerage, wealth management and insurance. Attendance to the event is exclusively by invitation only. Therefore, TLC is deeply honoured to be invited to the celebration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>In addition, Dato’ Howard Choo, CEO of our strategic partner, IBH Investment Bank was one of the VVIPs of the evening, as he also serves as the Chairman of Labuan Investment Bank Group.</p>

<p>TLC&#8217;s senior leaders have benefited a great deal from the event. Apart from getting to know Labuan’s financial ecosystem up close, we were able to integrate ourselves and let local counterparts know even more about us.</p>
<h5><strong>Top Leader Strategy Meeting: Mapping the Future</strong></h5>
<p>On the third day of the trip, the team arrived in Kuala Lumpur and went straight to JW Marriott Hotel for the Top Leader Strategy Meeting. TLC’s top management freely shared and analysed the Company&#8217;s overall operations to date at the meeting, as well as formulated new directions and policies to continue propelling the Group towards the global market.</p>
