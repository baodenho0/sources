<p>The US economy may be entering a period of significant improvements in employment. However, the labour market will be &#8220;well short&#8221; of the robust levels seen just before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>While there has been some positive economic news, the US economy has a long way to go before it reverses the substantial damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Bloomberg news report. In Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s testimony via video conference before the Senate Banking Committee, there were some indicators that have pointed to a stabilisation, and in some areas, a modest rebound, in economic activity.</p>
<p>The Commerce department reported that US retail sales rose in May by a better-than-expected 17.7%, the biggest jump in data going back to 1992. This follows a 14.7% slump in April. The May payrolls report, out on June 5, also came in unexpectedly strong. These developments led to high-yielding currencies edging lower against the greenback.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6909" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="246" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img2-24x16.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img2-36x24.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img2-48x32.jpg 48w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img2.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></p>
<p><strong>Path of recovery depends on disease containment</strong></p>
<p>However, much remains unclear about the fledgling recovery. Much of the economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it. Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.</p>
<p>The weeks of economic disruption as a result of the pandemic risk causing long-term scars by leaving millions out of work for an extended period and by destroying small businesses. If a small-sized or medium-sized business becomes insolvent because the economy recovers too slowly, the loss is more than just the business. Businesses are the heart of the economy and embody the work of generations.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainty creates investment opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Given that there are uncertainties in the road to recovery for the global economy and containment of the virus, volatility is expected to continue in major financial markets. This is the time when there are plentiful investment opportunities for investors to invest and grow their wealth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6910" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="241" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img3.jpg 648w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img3-24x16.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img3-36x24.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uncertain-path-for-recovery-of-US-economy-img3-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FROM</strong> <strong> CRISIS TO STRENGTH </strong></p>
<p>The present pandemic is causing economic challenges globally and causing distress for businesses. The present and future challenges are varied, but there are ways to survive tough times and move towards a position of strength.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6901" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f1-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="271" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f1-24x13.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f1-36x20.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f1-48x27.jpg 48w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f1.jpg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p><strong>Present and future challenges</strong></p>
<p>Businesses globally have been enduring much unpredictability and distress in a short span of time, as they coped for with supply chain disruptions, cost increases, a plunge in demand and revenues, and uncertainty about their sustainability. The business landscape is changing, as some business models will be obsolete and some plans will have to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Organisations such as Virgin Australia, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Frontier Communications, Flybe, Hertz Global Holdings, and Compass Airlines have filed for bankruptcy or shut down. Boeing, Emirates, Renault, Genting, and IBM have announced job cuts.</p>
<p>Businesses are fighting for their survival, as cash flow issues continue to weigh them down. Though the current situation is challenging, businesses should also focus on their recovery strategies and work towards gaining a position of strength in a changing landscape. True entrepreneurs are known for their resilience, nimbleness, and flexibility. These traits should tide them through tough times.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6902" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="320" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f2-24x16.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f2-36x24.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f2-48x32.jpg 48w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f2.jpg 744w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p><strong>Surviving tough times</strong></p>
<p>As cash flow is critical to the survival of businesses, they should rely on their credit lines, which can potentially provide a lifeline for businesses. However, this depends on the utilisation of credit lines, with short maturing periods, and can be affected during challenging economic times.</p>
<p>The ability of firms to roll over debts and the size of their cash buffers will also have a strong influence on their ability to cover operating losses and debt service obligations. Bridging loans would help ensure that the sudden stop to corporate cash-flows does not lead firms to a near term default on operating expenses, wages and salaries, or short-term obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Moving towards a position of strength</strong></p>
<p>Businesses that adopt digital solutions will be more likely to survive. The food and beverage sector can adopt online distribution channels. Education and medical clinics can also potentially adopt digital solutions in delivering their services. For other businesses, they may have to consider product diversification or provide value-added services to survive.</p>
<p>Making the transition to a platform model can accelerate efforts to digitise businesses. With ecosystems of technologies, services, and products that bring consumers and producers together, businesses can extend their reach when they are offering their products and services.</p>
<p>As talent is considered the most valuable asset in an organisation, it is important for business leaders to continue to attract and retain their employees through proper training and refreshment. Employees have four primary needs of their leaders, which are trust, compassion, stability, and hope.</p>
<p>When employees are enthusiastic about the future, they are more likely to be engaged in their work. With skills and competencies that enable them to adapt to the changing business environment, productivity, growth, and innovation within the business can be increased.</p>
<p>In conclusion, business can survive tough times and move towards a position of strength. Cash flow issues are most critical at present. They need to be addressed with credit lines and bridging loans to ensure continuity of businesses. Adoption of digital solutions and leadership from management are also important to spur recovery and movement towards a position of strength.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6895" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava2-e1592016198306-300x138.png" alt="" width="587" height="270" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava2-e1592016198306-300x138.png 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava2-e1592016198306-24x11.png 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava2-e1592016198306-36x17.png 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava2-e1592016198306-48x22.png 48w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava2-e1592016198306.png 607w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p>The merger symbolises a new chapter in the financial industry. It is foreseeable that the two powerful companies will bring even more outstanding investment projects and financial products that will benefit investors and institutions around the world. As the world is gradually recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, this comes as great news to investors and the live event has garnered a high number of online views.</p>
<p>CEO of AVA, Kyle Grandham said in his speech that both parties have progressed from the initial strategic partnership to M&amp;A, mainly because this move can greatly strengthen collaboration and development, while creating maximum benefits for investors. The integration of rich resources from LimestoneFX, a subsidiary of AVA, will provide unique investment value. In addition, the Global Wealth Fund (GWF) designed by IBH Investment Bank, the group’s financial advisor, has received overwhelming response from the market since its launch, which has also boosted their confidence for future development.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6896" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava3-e1592016532530-300x170.png" alt="" width="580" height="329" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava3-e1592016532530-300x170.png 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava3-e1592016532530-768x435.png 768w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava3-e1592016532530-24x14.png 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava3-e1592016532530-36x20.png 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava3-e1592016532530-48x27.png 48w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ava3-e1592016532530.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>Carl Ronny, CEO of TLC, is delighted with the collaboration and optimistic about the company&#8217;s development. He further stated that the five main objectives of M&amp;A include: reducing the cost of collaboration between both parties; enhancing the development performance of both parties; diversifying investments in high-growth financial products and markets; increasing market share and market positioning; strategic positioning and technological improvement. TLC&#8217;s vision for the company&#8217;s future development remains unchanged, and it will continue to provide clients with strategic investment solutions and excellent financial products.</p>
<p>The event’s special guest, Dato Howard from IBH Investment Bank, said in his speech that under the bank’s coordination and control, the merger will bring about a comprehensive investment ecosystem. After a year of working together, IBH and TLC have devoted themselves to the enhancement of investment risk management. The new system will instill higher level of confidence and generate more sustainable returns for clients.Limestone CEO Vladimir Lem looks forward to sparking new ideas and achievements with TLC in the financial industry. As Limestone has an excellent trading platform while the strength of TLC’s trading team is recognised by many, the advantages of both parties are now combined and is expected to provide more promising and valuable investment projects for investors of global forex.</p>
<p>During the event, AVA and Limestone announced that both companies are now official sponsors of Legacy Racing Team, where a sponsorship contract was signed to show their support for GT racing. The exhilarating showcase of speed is also significant of the company&#8217;s unrelenting pursuit for excellence in financial services, while highlighting the zeitgeist of our time. The two firms are hopeful that the popular racing event will introduce more investors to AVA and Limestone.</p>

<p>The M&amp;A signing ceremony was a huge success and ended on a happy note. All eyes are now on the innovations and investments that will be initiated by AVA following the integration and upgrade of capabilities and resources between the companies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, a global pandemic of the new coronavirus has caused a huge impact on the world economy. The collapse of the US economy caused the Federal Reserve to make the largest intervention in financial markets in history, US stocks had repeatedly triggered the fuse mechanism, and the oil price of WTI futures contracts became negative. Shocking news, such as the value and the erratic fluctuation of gold, caused huge panic and shock in the financial markets. The damage caused by the epidemic to all walks of life and the financial turmoil is distressful for many companies.</p>

<p>We have seen countries globally initiate currency interventions, led by the United States, and injected unprecedented amounts of funds into the financial markets. The Federal Reserve also announced unlimited quantitative easing policies. One after another, the destructive factors spread to the currency market, making the forex market experience unprecedented large-scale currency fluctuations. We expect that economic impact will eventually manifest itself in exchange rate fluctuations, resulting in forex volatility, which will continue to exist in the coming year.</p>
<p>In a market with a lot of uncertainties, forex hedge funds have become the most promising financial investment. When the Covid-19 pandemic brought the global economy to a standstill, forex hedge funds <strong>performed better than other investment methods</strong> in the market. This environment is <strong>favourable to reducing the risk of loss, while generating stable income simultaneously.</strong></p>

<p>Global Wealth Fund&#8217;s (GWF) GW Profit 2 was 9% in mid-to-late April, primarily through gains in the gold commodity, as investors fled chaotic markets to seek refuge in safe haven investment instruments. According to GWF Aggressive Class Performance Report, the GW Profit 2 fund generated 9% returns during the 16th April 2020 to 30th April 2020 period.</p>
<p>The fund adopted a high-risk high-return investment strategy by trading gold, generating returns of 4.2% for the week. Gold momentum was driven by the reported failure of experimental COVID-19 drugs, new US relief package worth USD 484bil, the fear of a double-hit from the upcoming flu season and COVID-19 taking place at the same time during winter, and the historical price collapse of oil futures to -USD37.</p>
<p>Gold has touched a multi-year high of USD1750 per ounce. Demand level around USD1656 held out strongly, pushing gold prices back up to USD1707 after a brief drop. From a technical perspective, gold has created an upward ascending movement. With this in mind, bulls are in control. USD1780 is the next resistance level to watch out for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6879" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/h2-e1589512627721.png" alt="" width="440" height="220" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/h2-e1589512627721.png 738w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/h2-e1589512627721-300x150.png 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/h2-e1589512627721-24x12.png 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/h2-e1589512627721-36x18.png 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/h2-e1589512627721-48x24.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>During the 15th April 2020 to 21st April 2020 period, the financial markets were feeling the jitters and investors were running to safe haven instruments, such as gold, as a result of oil futures hitting an all-time low of -USD37. Gold was primed for a move-up. From a technical perspective, it has the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) crossing up, and the momentum indicator showing up, prompting the purchase of gold.</p>
<p>During the 22nd April 2020 to 28th April 2020 period, market sentiment was towards a risk-taking mood, as each US state started easing slowly on their lockdown measures. This was an indicator that Gold will be pressured downwards. From a technical perspective, the momentum indicator was turning down, and MACD was crossing downwards, prompting the sale of gold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Generating secondary sources of income beyond the pandemic</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6868" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v1.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="304" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v1.jpg 864w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v1-24x14.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v1-36x20.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v1-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<p>Building secondary sources of income helps us to grow our wealth and reach our financial goals. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the ways income can be generated. In this feature, we will explore various ways of generating secondary sources of income beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Pandemic changes industries</strong></p>
<p>With public events getting cancelled and people being encouraged to avoid crowds, the travel and tourism industries are seeing a steep drop in demand. Manufacturers connected to global supply chains are experiencing severe disruptions. Around the world, there are empty streets and restaurants, with struggles in local communities. Our social fabric is disrupted. However, technology is playing a role in accelerating progress for solutions to the pandemic. The ways people work and communicate are changing. Convocations, meetings, conferences, events, and social events are occurring digitally. People are working and students are studying remotely from home.</p>
<p>The pandemic is also causing economic disruption and unemployment. Although unemployment protection, which allows resources to be accumulated in good times and released in times of economic distress like the current pandemic, guarantees a certain standard of living for workers who have lost their jobs, not every country has unemployment insurance and not all workers or enterprises benefit from such measures.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple sources of income</strong></p>
<p>These unprecedented challenges will change the ways secondary sources of income can be generated, but conventional wisdom will still prevail. Creating your product, offering your service, and diversifying your investments can help you generate secondary sources of income.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6869" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v2.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="350" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v2.jpg 617w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v2-24x16.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v2-36x24.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v2-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></p>
<p>If you are creative and savvy, you can create a product by thinking outside the box until you can come up with a new idea that fills a need. Digital products can also be attractive, such as online courses and e-books. With people staying at home more often as a result of the pandemic, there is greater interest in self-improvement activities, such as reading e-books and studying for academic development.</p>
<p>Offering a service or selling something to diversify your income may help you to build passive income that builds slowly over the years. Offering a service is often one of the best and least uncomfortable ways to earn side income while doing something that you love.</p>
<p>Another popular second income option is being an Introducing Broker (IB) , it is a way of building your passive income consistently. By introducing new customers to a Forex brokerage, you will receive IB’s commission, which is a certain share of the spread or commission charged by the brokerage. As forex investment is an emerging and fast-growing trend in the changing economic landscape, wealth-building opportunities are abundant in this field. The advantages of being an Introducing Broker is that this career path grants you time flexibility, allows you to work from home, generates consistent stable income, and allows you to gain income from clients’ trades.</p>
<p><strong>Diversifying your investment</strong></p>
<p>In the world of investment, we should never “put all our eggs in one basket”, where we should not concentrate all efforts and resources in one area, because we can lose everything when disaster strikes. Investing in a single asset class is insufficient for us to meet our investment objectives. When we expand our investment environment from a single asset class to multiple asset classes, and from local to international markets, the risk of focusing in a single asset is reduced.</p>
<p>You may consider our financial products, such as our Global Wealth Fund (GWF) and forex managed funds, which are considered relatively stable and safe forms of investments. Alternatively, for investors that are starting out, consider starting with small amounts of investment and join our Introduced Broker (IB) programme to gain more wealth, which can be used as your future investment funds. Accumulating wealth starts with a simple step, and taking the first step brings benefits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6870" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v3.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="327" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v3.jpg 568w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v3-24x16.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v3-36x24.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/v3-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many ways to generate secondary sources of income. By reflecting on industry changes, tapping into multiple sources of income, and diversifying your income, you will progress on your journey of building your wealth. Achieve your financial goals by our financial solutions and participate in our Introduced Broker programme today!</p>

<p><em>The COVID-19 pandemic requires change in business and investment approaches</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6857" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t1.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="324" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t1.jpg 743w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t1-36x24.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t1-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented suffering. Beyond being a threat to health, it has caused economic, social, and mental suffering in many cases. As the COVID-19 pandemic is causing economic disruption, TLC is changing its trading and corporate strategy, and engaging in public welfare efforts to support its investors and the public.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 pandemic causes economic disruption</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is causing global economic contraction, placing airlines globally at bankruptcy risk, and causing the collapse of oil prices, among other developments. According to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) World Economic Outlook April 2020 report, the COVID-19 pandemic is inflicting high and rising human costs worldwide, and the necessary protection measures are severely impacting economic activity. As a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by –3 percent in 2020, much worse than during the 2008–09 financial crisis. In a baseline scenario, which assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and containment efforts can be gradually unwound, the global economy is projected to grow by 5.8 percent in 2021 as economic activity normalises, helped by policy support.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6858" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t2.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t2.jpg 622w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t2-24x14.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t2-36x20.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t2-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>The collapse of Virgin Australia Holdings after the briefest of fights indicates the world&#8217;s weakest airlines have little time to secure funds before they succumb to the coronavirus, according to The Straits Times. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents nearly 300 airlines, has said half face bankruptcy in two to three months without government help. Many carriers have furloughed staff and grounded entire fleets. IATA has warned that 25 million jobs in aviation and related sectors are at risk.</p>
<p>Falling oil demand and excessive oil supply are causing the collapse of oil prices. According to a CNN report, the coronavirus pandemic has caused oil demand to drop so rapidly that the world is running out of room to store barrels. Demand continues to vanish because jets, cars, and factories are side-lined by the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia flooded the world with excess supply. This has led to the collapse of oil prices, making it impossible for US shale oil companies to make money and causing prices for US crude for May delivery to turn negative recently.</p>

<p>The pandemic is resulting in challenges in forex trading activities, requiring changes in corporate strategies. With unprecedented turmoil impacting the world economy, TLC&#8217;s inhouse trading department is facing challenges with Expert Advisor (EA) technical trend recognition, according to TLC EA trading department chief trader Jason Lim. Compared to pre-COVID-19 crisis periods, the fundamental and technical EA signals are not in sync. The spread from the liquidity provider (LP) is unstable and frequently stop-out EA trend spotting. The EA has to spot a good spread to enter the market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6859" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t3.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="292" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t3.jpg 707w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t3-24x14.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t3-36x20.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/t3-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></p>
<p>Given that risk management is the first priority in trading, large lot size entering the market is causing slippage problems from the main server of LP MetaTrader4, resulting in sudden cancellations of pending orders when they have been set up. This situation is challenging to the risk management team. These challenges are being resolved by reducing trading lot sizes and enhancing the existing trading server to provide the similar trading results compared to pre-COVID-19 crisis times.</p>
<p>To remain relevant and competitive in the changing economic landscape, AVA and TLC recently established a strategic partnership to pursue their mission of growing the wealth of their investors, by generating stable long-term income, through a mutually beneficial environment, with a rich diversified selection of capital investment channels.</p>
<p>TLC chief executive officer Carl Ronny stated that he wants TLC to be a multidimensional, multinational, and technologically integrated financial company.  His strategy is to be consolidated with more experts globally in different areas. &#8220;AVA is another piece of the puzzle that we want to be incorporated and associated with. Due to AVA having the same vision as TLC in the long term, we consider this alliance a winning move, similar to our alliances in previous years that enable our investors to reap their rewards.&#8221;</p>
<p>AVA will invest into a global cross-section asset class covering derivatives, cryptocurrencies, forex, debt instruments like MTNs and Certificates of Deposits, higher yield instrument and products like equities, intra-day commodities trading, and real estate. The core investment portfolio will have the features of fast market access, tactical asset allocation, early participation for yield enhancement, and tailored investments based on AVA Investment Committee risk appetite. The key investment strategy now is not to just rely on Forex, but using a diversified strategic asset allocation approach.</p>

<p>28th April 2020 – TLC and its strategic alliance partner, AVA held a live-streaming interview for the first time to discuss and announce the partnership’s strategic plans, as well as the direction for future collaborations. The live-streaming event attracted the attention of investors worldwide who are eager to get first-hand news of the industry. Peak ratings exceeded 1,000 viewers, a testament that the two companies are highly regarded by investors.</p>
<p>The decision to take the interview online is aligned with the social-distancing policy implemented by countries around the world. Based on the interview, it is obvious that the management already has a contingency plan in place for the sudden change in economy and appears to have full confidence in the strategy.</p>
<p>The interview featured an influential guest line-up that comprises key members of the two companies. Special guests included Carl Ronny, CEO of TLC; Kyle Grandham, CEO of AVA; and TLC’s top management team – CMO Jay Wong, CTO Jack Yau, COO Allan Chang and Marketing Director David Liew.</p>
<p>Carl Ronny revealed that the main reason for forming the alliance with AVA is that both parties share a common long-term vision. Hence, this move is definitely a mutually beneficial one – much like the way TLC’s previous strategic partners have strengthened the business, boosted its performance and enabled investment partners to reap abundant returns. It has always been TLC&#8217;s commitment to expand the company&#8217;s business and contribute to the advancement of FinTech. The collaboration with AVA, a prestigious financial consultancy from New Zealand, will certainly help to realise the company&#8217;s strategy while combining the talents of financial experts from around the world.</p>
<p>Global Wealth Fund (GWF) is the first financial product released under the alliance. The investment portfolio comprises forex hedging trading and capital management, which are the strong suits of TLC and AVA respectively. The diversified portfolio helps global investors generate long-term returns in a volatile economic environment. On the pandemic’s impact on the company, he said TLC will always remain positive regardless of market conditions. The fact that the company continues to operate as usual during such challenging times and its partners are still enjoying profitable returns is enough to prove TLC&#8217;s commitment towards the business and investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6850" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aplex-va3-2.jpg" alt="" width="371" height="537" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aplex-va3-2.jpg 600w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aplex-va3-2-207x300.jpg 207w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aplex-va3-2-17x24.jpg 17w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aplex-va3-2-25x36.jpg 25w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aplex-va3-2-33x48.jpg 33w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, Kyle Grandham expressed sincere thanks to AVA’s new strategic partner. Since AVA’s client base is mainly in the Europe, Australia and New Zealand; he admits that the partnership with TLC has undoubtedly unlocked a large slice of the Asian market for the company, while comprehensively enhancing the development potential of the business, making AVA a truly global organisation. At the same time, he believes that Asia will be the future of economic markets in the 21st century. AVA&#8217;s managed fund is up to US$120 million, and the launch of Global Wealth Fund (GWF) is not only the first step taken by the alliance, but is also the best opportunity for global investors to achieve their financial goals in wealth-building.</p>
<p>In the later part of the interview, key members of TLC&#8217;s marketing, technology and operations departments expressed views from the perspective of their respective fields. All of them maintain an optimistic outlook towards market trends even though the global economy is currently hit by the pandemic and experiencing unprecedented turmoil. Although it will take more than six months to a year to recover, they believe conditions will stabilise in time. The forex platform&#8217;s performance in particular, is still going strong under the grim conditions of the stock and futures markets. For this, TLC would like to thank investors worldwide for their confidence in the platform.</p>
<p>The launch of Global Wealth Fund (GWF) is one of the best rewards for investors, while at the same time shows the ambitions of the two corporate giants in the financial industry. The market is seeing a growing anticipation towards the announcement of future plans from TLC and AVA.</p>

<p>Recently, TLC and Aplex VA (AVA) launched the first investment fund immediately after announcing a major cooperation plan, which attracted great attention from the international financial community.</p>
<p>After the recent “Global Wealth Fund Launch” video conference on zoom ,many investment partners form all around the world were eager to learn more. Obviously, the market is full of expectation and has confidence in this fund. One of the reasons is that TLC has proven its strength with a good reputation and consistent roi from forex trading to its members.</p>
<p>Recently, the global stock market encountered a large number of sell-offs, and the stock price has fallen sharply. Even when governments of various countries launched financial aid and economic revitalisation programs, they had no effect. The launch of the Global Wealth Fund is in line with today&#8217;s severe and special economic conditions, allowing investors to seize the opportunity to accumulate wealth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Flexible Fund with Good Return</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6844" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g2-2.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="434" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g2-2.jpg 594w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g2-2-256x300.jpg 256w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g2-2-20x24.jpg 20w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g2-2-31x36.jpg 31w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g2-2-41x48.jpg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>Global Wealth Fund (referred to as GWF) invests mainly in funds of large listed companies&#8217; stocks (large markets), bonds, and other currency instruments, according to market prospects, and looks forward to gain good returns in a bullish market. The supervisory bank behind the fund is the well-known IBH investment bank from Labuan.</p>
<p>Its additional advantage is its flexibility and diversity. As the company chooses a variety of potentially profitable investment portfolios, it can play an important role in the development of equity.</p>
<p>The combination of ideas and the broad international vision also makes the cooperation plan between TLC and AVA have strong development potential. With the strength of two companies&#8217; teams and generous return of interests, the results are expected to be very impressive.</p>
<p>The main features of the GWF fund also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong continuous income</li>
<li>Circular revenue growth</li>
<li>High operating leverage</li>
<li>Low capital and high intensity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Targets precisely match elastic strategies</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6845" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g3.png" alt="" width="408" height="289" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g3.png 794w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g3-300x213.png 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g3-768x545.png 768w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g3-24x17.png 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g3-36x26.png 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g3-48x34.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p>Regarding investment objectives, GWF invests mainly in diversified investment portfolios in public and private markets, generating excess returns through medium- and long-term capital appreciation. It is expected to become a dazzling benchmark from the challenging prospects, and to eliminate market barriers of high asset valuations and low yields.</p>
<p>GWF funds protect investor’s initial investment by investing in high-quality short-term money markets and diversified portfolios. As money market funds have very high daily liquidity, fund managers are allowed to buy or redeem shares or units on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In terms of investment strategy, the fund mainly invests in stocks (large markets), bonds, and other currency instruments of large listed companies. It looks forward to generating returns in a bullish market.</p>
<p>When the market is about to rebound from the trough and the stock market has not yet rushed back to the bull market, it is definitely the best time to absorb high-quality stocks at a bargain. In addition, TLC&#8217;s forex trading experience will also complement each other and create huge profits through forex hedge funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6846" src="http://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g4-2.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="191" srcset="https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g4-2.jpg 587w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g4-2-300x98.jpg 300w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g4-2-24x8.jpg 24w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g4-2-36x12.jpg 36w, https://www.tlcglobal.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/g4-2-48x16.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p>
<p><strong>Global Wealth Fund (GWF) is a rare opportunity for investors to accelerate wealth building</strong></p>
<p><u>Holding profit asset allocation</u></p>
<p>If the market trend lacks stability, a relatively conservative strategy is adopted to keep more investment in the fixed income port, so as to maintain profitability. The key is to seek absolute returns within the medium and long-term investment range.</p>
<p>GWF contains asset allocation at the intermediate and aggressive class, and these classes represent the level of risk. The intermediate class’s asset allocation includes bonds, securities, and high-yield time deposits; whereby the aggressive class includes stocks, currencies, and digital assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>The Grand Launch Offer Should Not Be Missed</u></p>
<p>Now that GWF funds are open for subscriptions, investors only need a low investment amount of less than $1,500 to start subscribing to fund units and accumulate wealth. The TLC, which has always been generous with promos, has opened 30,000 promo units to allow investors to enjoy extra GW Profit.</p>
<p>At the same time, TLC has not forgotten the welfare of our loyalty investment partners, and has set up special &#8220;loyalty member promo&#8221;. Members that meet several conditions can enjoy a 5% performance fee rebate.</p>
<p>Global Wealth Fund is merely a starting point, TLC and AVA will launch more high-quality investment projects in the future, on the same time lead a new investment trend.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>16<sup>th</sup> April 2020 is a significant day in the foreign exchange industry. TLC is honoured to officially announce its strategic partnership with Aplex VA Limited. Combined with the strength of both parties, it will further consolidate the important deployment of its global market map.
